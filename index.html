            <li>Write one paragraph summarizing what semantic elements are (max of 150 words)</li>
            <li>Create a new git repository on your computer. Name it semantic-elements.</li>
            <li>Inside the repo, code an HTML document. Name it index.html.</li>
            <li>Use at least 15 different types of HTML elements (correctly!).</li>
            <li>View your document in a browser to ensure it displays as you expect.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>Read the articles listed on the Lesson 02 Overview page.</li>
              <li>Code a semantically structured HTML document using the following
                content sectioning.</li>
              <li>Create a new Git repository on your computer called “portfolio”.
                This will be the home base for all future assignments, and the pages you start
                coding here today will be progressively built upon for your final course project.</li>
              <li>In this portfolio directory, create a simple, two page site. The pages
                should link to each other in the main navigation. One of the pages should
                be a list of projects that you have done, each with a title, small image,
                and link to location of project. Be sure to include week 1's assignment!
                I know you might not have a lot of projects to link to right now- just use
                dummy data and links that go to “#” to flesh it out as necessary. The second
                page can be whatever you like, though "About Me" is a nice default. Whichever
                you would like to be the landing page for the site should be named index.html.</li>
              <li>Use dummy content wherever you like on these pages (feel free to use
                 <a href="https://lipsum.com/">Lorem Ipsum</a>. We'll be revisiting this project over
                the next several weeks, and you can add more content as we go. The focus should be on
                writing clean, semantic HTML. We will add CSS to this site starting next week. Please
                do not do any styling this week.</li>
              <li>There are no length requirements on these pages, but I expect each to have header,
                article, and footer sections, with relevant, semantic content within each.
                File names should be "kebab style" (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces) and internal
                links should be correct. As always, style matters. If you are including local images,
                they should be inside a directory called "images" within the main project directory.</li>
              <li>Remember to view your pages in different browsers before turning this in. If you've
                made HTML errors that reduce the functionality of the page, you'll lose points, and
                they're easy to catch by just viewing it in a browser! You should also remember to
                always <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">validate your code</a>.</li>
              <li>Use git to commit as you go along. Create a GitHub repository called 'portfolio'
                and link it to your local repository. Push your work up to GitHub, and submit a link
                to the GitHub repo for the assignment. Refer to Lessons 00 and 01 if you need a refresher
                on git & GitHub.</li>

        <h2 id="three">Lesson Three</h2>
          <p><img src="husky-three.jpg" alt="a sleepy husky" height="150" width="200"></p>
          <p><a href="#">Lesson Three is Incomplete</a></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Create a directory called 'styles' and within it, stylesheet.css. In this
                stylesheet, write some styling for your portfolio site. This file must have at
                least 50 lines of code. Use your design skills or just experiment. This assignment
                is about using CSS properly, not design.</li>
              <li>Use the <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS validator</a> to
                check the quality of your code.</li>
              <li>Include a link to the stylesheet in the head section of each of the html pages.
                This would also be a good opportunity to add more content to these HTML pages.</li>
              <li>Use git to commit your work as you go. Push your work up to your “portfolio” repository
                on GitHub master branch, and submit a link to the GitHub repo for the assignment. I will
                view the pages via your personal GitHub Pages URL and expect everything to be functional
                (no broken images or links, etc). Refer to Lesson 00 and 01 if you need a refresher on Git & GitHub.</li>
